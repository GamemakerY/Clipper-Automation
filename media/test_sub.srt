1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,550
I challenged the biggest creators
on YouTube

2
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,950
to try to beat this game
for $250,000.

3
00:00:05,983 --> 00:00:07,533
[cheering]

4
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:08,567
Let's go!

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,250
Run, run, run!

6
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:13,100
I separated these 8 teams
into their own lobbies,

7
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:16,617
and the first 4 teams to make it
to the end together will move on.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,700
Just lock in. Lock in.

9
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:18,600
We got this.

10
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,083
Make sure you're sprinting.

11
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:21,833
Alright. Trampoline. Jump!

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,650
Good. Alright, here we gotta break it.

13
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:25,133
We gotta break this wall
to open it.

14
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,667
Yup, yup. Nice, nice.
Keep going.

15
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,267
You need everyone on the platform!

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,500
Stop, stop, stop.

17
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,767
Keep going.
Let’s go, let’s go.

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,283
Alright, there we go.
Now you can move on.

19
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,333
- Karl, come on!
- Karl, we're on the platform!

20
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,867
So far, no teams have finished.

21
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
I really hope you guys
enjoy this video.

22
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:41,367
This is a phenomenal set,
and we literally have 32 creators here.

23
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,417
There’s fire.
Just go around.

24
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,750
Oh my God,
that was clutch.

25
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,767
Oh I'm so sorry guys,
I fell in the lava.

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,433
Keep going.

27
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,700
Oh, there’s lasers!

28
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,833
Just don’t stop.
Just keep on going.

29
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,617
Don’t get knocked off.

30
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,750
Switch, switch, switch.

31
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:56,500
It's off.

32
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,983
Yeah, I'm-- I’m towards the end.

33
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,117
We're here, we're here.

34
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm coming.

35
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:01,800
Take your time on the hammers.

36
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,883
[screams] Guys!

37
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,283
- Come on, come on!
- Go, go, go! [screams]

38
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,767
Oh, we got our first finish!

39
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
[cheering]

40
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,417
Let's go team!

41
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,783
We gotta be the winners.
Come on.

42
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:11,767
I'm at the end.

43
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,467
You’re so close.
One more, one more.

44
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:15,133
Get on the button!

45
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:15,983
[cheering]

46
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,750
We got our second finish.

47
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:19,200
Only two teams remain!

48
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,283
We can't get eliminated.
Come on.

49
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:21,967
We made it, I made it.
Get over here.

50
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,317
No!

51
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,133
The Mr Beast team's about to lose.

52
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,500
Guys, it's our channel!

53
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,967
We're waiting on Karl and Tareq!

54
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,317
[screams]

55
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,167
I’m almost there.

56
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,667
Jump and you got it!

57
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,767
Let's go!

58
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,350
[cheering]

59
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,467
One spot remains!
Who are we waiting on?

60
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,467
You’re right there, Jeza.

61
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,117
Ok, ok.

62
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,717
Only one spot. One spot!

63
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,667
No!

64
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,950
Gotta go over, dash over.

65
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,067
Come on.

66
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:45,900
Yes!

67
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,183
[cheering]

68
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,533
And we have our final spot!

69
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,167
No!

70
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,267
That was so close.

71
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,700
Unfortunately,
if you're standing in front of an X,

72
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,750
you have been eliminated.

73
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,167
I need you to exit the set.

74
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,733
And to those of you that are still here,

75
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:03,917
you're one step closer
to winning your fans $250,000.

76
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone head up
to the 2nd layer.

77
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,783
- How we feeling grey team?
- Confident.

78
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,850
Yellow team, only one team's
getting eliminated this round.

79
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:12,933
Is it gonna be you guys?

80
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:13,800
It's gonna be them.

81
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,833
Oh, it's gonna be orange?

82
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,233
I thought we were friends.

83
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,117
I like this.
Let's get this game going.

84
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,100
For this dungeon, you will not be able
to move on in each section

85
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,883
until you kill every single enemy.

86
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:24,817
Everyone ready?

87
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,467
Yeah!

88
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,433
Yeah!

89
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,283
Go!

90
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,200
Alright, go, go, go.

91
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,200
Let's go, let's go.

92
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,017
Go, go, go.

93
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,550
Spam your abilities.

94
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,333
A bomb! Bomb!
Watch out for the bomb.

95
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,700
Alright, there's enemies right here.
Easy, easy.

96
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,950
Use your arrows as well.

97
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:37,850
There we go.

98
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:39,183
I'll go on top.
Top, top.

99
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,067
I got one.

100
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh my god.

101
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,000
Nice, go team.
Go, go, go. Keep goin'!

102
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:45,750
We're going up.

103
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,033
Purple team's in the lead.

104
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:48,950
I think we're good.

105
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:49,817
We're through.

106
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,383
Spam, spam, spam.

107
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,367
Last one, last one.

108
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,100
Last one.

109
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,783
Go, go, go.

110
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,517
Onto the next, onto the next.

111
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,417
We got this, guys.

112
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Guys, enemy on me.
Big enemy on me.

113
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,533
There's big enemies.

114
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,867
We need to, like,
group up on them guys.

115
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,267
Push him in, push him in.

116
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,650
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

117
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,650
Oh, this is easy, boys. Easy.

118
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,183
Alright, these two teams are winning.

119
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,217
Oh, my God.

120
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,517
We're cruising.

121
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,417
But it’s not how are you start,
it's how you finish.

122
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,867
Alright. Here we go.

123
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,683
Yo watch out for the bombers!
They're bombers here!

124
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:16,833
There's so many bombs.

125
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, I'm slamming this guy
with my guitar.

126
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:22,167
And in case you forgot,
the winning team gets $250,000

127
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
that they get to give
to their subscribers.

128
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,100
Fans. I'm doing this for y'all, man.

129
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:25,817
I’m here.

130
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,633
Yep. Got 'em.

131
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,867
Wait, doors open.

132
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,333
Go, go, go.

133
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,083
If you're wondering
what game all of them are playing,

134
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,117
it's called King of Meat.

135
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,950
King of Meat gave us skins in game,
these custom dungeons,

136
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:37,950
and even made a secret dungeon
for you to play at home.

137
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,883
Just click the link in description
or scan this QR code.

138
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,967
Available on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.

139
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,667
I see an arch over here.
I'm taking 'em out.

140
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:44,900
We did it!
Come on guys,

141
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,633
Thank you King of Meat
for sponsoring this video.

142
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,750
Alright, let's focus.

143
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:48,700
I don't see anymore.

144
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,150
Go, go, go.

145
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:50,783
Let's go.

146
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,217
Let's go! Final round.

147
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,417
Alright, time to kill the boss.
Let's go.

148
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,867
Oh! He’s massive.

149
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,100
What's up, big guy?

150
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,317
Focus the boss.
Guys, we need to work together on him.

151
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,000
You guys are on track to be eliminated.

152
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,367
Stop, no, that's not true.

153
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
That sucks.

154
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,550
Everyone's already in the boss room
but you guys.

155
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,567
Gotta get ahead.

156
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,700
Let's go. Blow them all up.
Use the explosive barrels.

157
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,833
Yeah, it's getting stuck in my ability.

158
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,850
He’s so low.

159
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,083
Guys, we gotta lock it on the boss.

160
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:14,883
We got this.

161
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,683
Everyone's on the same level.

162
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,133
Who's gonna finish first?

163
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:19,683
He's low, he’s low.

164
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,383
Ok. We got it, we got it.

165
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,067
Yeah, he's dead.

166
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,617
Nice, nice.

167
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,450
Go, go, go!

168
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,900
That's the end!

169
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,950
Go, go, go!

170
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:27,667
Come on.

171
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,983
[cheering]

172
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:31,283
We got our first finish!

173
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,717
Oh my God, they made it.

174
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,233
Get on the button.

175
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:34,867
Come on, everyone!

176
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,067
Yes!

177
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Woo!

178
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,517
Either Grey or Orange
is about to be eliminated!

179
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,700
Go, go, go!

180
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,817
It's gonna be us.
Come on!

181
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,367
I died!

182
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,500
Ok, come on.
Just a couple more.

183
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,133
We're good.

184
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:47,800
Go, go!

185
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,217
- Where do I go?
- Run in!

186
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,733
Let’s go! Let’s go!

187
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,267
Go, go, go!
Run the door!

188
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,017
I'm running!

189
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,133
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

190
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,133
We did it!

191
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:54,933
No!

192
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:55,800
No!

193
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,483
Sorry, it didn't work out, Grey team.

194
00:04:58,517 --> 00:04:59,500
It's ok. It happens.

195
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,483
And with that,
you three teams are moving on!

196
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,617
[cheering]

197
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,650
This next round is going to require you
to work as a team.

198
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,117
For this round,
you don't have to kill everything you see,

199
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,617
what you have to do is protect
the most precious cargo on the planet.

200
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,267
This Meat Baby.

201
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,067
Each section in this round,

202
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,750
a player will have to pick up
the meat baby.

203
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,083
If they drop the meat baby,

204
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,967
you'll have to go back
and retrieve it.

205
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He'll be on the rest of your team
to protect that player

206
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:33,117
and usher them through
while they carry the meat baby.

207
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,200
Alright, any questions?

208
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,300
Wait, is this--

209
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,800
Three, two, one…

210
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,717
Go!

211
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,333
Go, go, go, go!

212
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:41,467
And they're off.

213
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,033
Oh, the sausage. Wait, grab it.

214
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,417
There is the meat baby.

215
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,450
- Socks. Get it, get it.
- I got it, I got it.

216
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,233
Alright, we'll stay in front.
You stay in the back.

217
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:48,950
Ok. Wait. What is this?

218
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,483
Watch out. Watch out for that white.
Don't touch those. Oh!

219
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,700
Don't press those platforms.

220
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,233
That slows you down?
Oh my God.

221
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:55,433
Move up, move up.

222
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,467
Oh wait, guys.

223
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,150
It died!

224
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,700
Alright, you guys
already broke your sausage!

225
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,817
Go back
and get a new one.

226
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,950
Oh, ok. If you take a single hit,
you drop.

227
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,517
Purple team is making it through,
they’re escorting the sausage.

228
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,233
Go, go, go!

229
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,600
Put the sausage on the grill!

230
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,800
Put it down.
Nice. Let's go.

231
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,550
There's a platform.

232
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,517
In the middle!

233
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,583
Ready?
Three, two, one, go!

234
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:12,983
Ok, watch out! Don’t get hit!

235
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,333
Yeah, yeah!

236
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,150
You got it.

237
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,883
Nice! Let's go.

238
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,767
Yellow, you seem to be in last.

239
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,250
I got it, don’t worry--

240
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,400
Team! Come on, team!

241
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,733
Get your act together, yellow.

242
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,817
Uh, more meat. Where's the meat at?

243
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,367
Oh, it's in there.
Someone has to go above.

244
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,300
Here's the 4th one.

245
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,500
I’m on one!

246
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,683
Got it!

247
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:31,617
Alright, grab the sausage.

248
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,400
I’ll grab it.

249
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,517
Stay on the platform.

250
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,883
Alright, I'm standing on it.

251
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,433
Wait, wait.
Let me get on it.

252
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,317
There you go.

253
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,050
Now, get ready to switch when I say “go.”

254
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,383
Ok, go, go, go!

255
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,233
Switch, switch!

256
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,450
What are you guys doing?
Why do you always crush?

257
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:45,467
We're the best team ever!

258
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,550
Since you're so far
in the lead,

259
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,200
I wanna tell you about
our brand-new Feastables bag

260
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,150
that just dropped
in Costco's nationwide.

261
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:52,167
Here, do you mind giving it a try?

262
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,417
Guys, I’m getting hit!

263
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,217
Oh! Ok, I'm gonna stop talking.

264
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,133
You still got it!
Fry it! Fry that meat!

265
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,533
Throw it in the fire.

266
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:00,067
Nice!

267
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,333
Ok, next one.
Same thing, same thing.

268
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,717
We have to wait for the platform
to get back.

269
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,717
Do you wanna try Feastables
out of our new Costco bag?

270
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,917
It's gonna wrap
in front of you, BT!

271
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,583
- BT, it’s gonna wrap in front of you--
- No!

272
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:09,250
Don't die, don’t--

273
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,150
No!

274
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,217
Ok, go, go, go.

275
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,733
Yeah, yeah. Careful.
Just stay on it.

276
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,883
Nice, nice. Keep goin’.

277
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:16,933
Nice!

278
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,317
Alright, purple’s in the lead again.

279
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,633
Yes, yes!
We're good, we're good.

280
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,767
Throw it on, throw it on!

281
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,767
- Ok. Perfect.
- We're good. Just go.

282
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,150
I'm on the next one.

283
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,167
The platform’s coming from the side.
Platform coming from the side.

284
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,933
Get ready to get on it.

285
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,550
Yeah. Nice, nice, nice.

286
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,933
Now you have you have to cross
to the other side.

287
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,550
Nice, yeah. She made it!

288
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,683
Keep going, go, go, go!

289
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:36,267
Let's go. Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

290
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,617
Once again,
purple is very much in the lead.

291
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,650
Blue sending now.

292
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,417
Alright, Hyper, send it back!

293
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,350
Let’s go, Hyper!

294
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:44,567
Yes! I’m through!

295
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,950
Oh my God, you did it!

296
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,967
All three teams are on the same course.

297
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,317
This one's the hardest one.
Good luck.

298
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,067
Ok, we need two people on the thing.
I'm going onto the platform.

299
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,033
This looks easy, right?

300
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,150
Oh my God, it's zombies.

301
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,483
Oh, except for the never-ending army
of mobs coming at you.

302
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,750
There's enemies everywhere!

303
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,717
Fight 'em off, guys.

304
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,883
I’m fighting.

305
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:01,950
I see enemies at the end.

306
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,350
No, he's good, he's good.

307
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,400
Alright, will purple get it?

308
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,383
I got, I got, I got it!

309
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,767
Alright. Now you gotta get
the whole team across.

310
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,067
We got this, we got this!

311
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,717
Alright, let’s go, go, go!
Guys, let’s go!

312
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,733
First finish!

313
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,467
It’s either orange or yellow.
Who's it gonna be?

314
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:16,783
Ok, I got it, I got it.

315
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,117
Get on the platform!

316
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,133
Wait, there’s skeletons here.

317
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,933
Ed there's--
You can't let those touch you, Ed!

318
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,917
Ed, jump!

319
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,083
Hold E, hold E!

320
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,483
- No, I died!
- No!

321
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:26,300
We gotta go back.

322
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,400
Oh, no.

323
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,900
We're so close.
It's right there.

324
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,683
I'll attack the enemies.
You guys just stand!

325
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't let go.
You can jump over, probably.

326
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,650
Yellow’s about to do it!

327
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:37,383
You guys gotta stay on those platforms!
Stay on those platforms.

328
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,450
Jump over.

329
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,867
Yes! Yes!

330
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:41,283
- Go, go, go! Run!
- Come across!

331
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:42,350
Everyone come across.

332
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,000
Get on the button!

333
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:43,850
We’re about to do it.

334
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,317
Come on, come on!

335
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,417
[cheering]

336
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,667
- Let's go!
- King of Meat!

337
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,483
Orange team,
you have been eliminated.

338
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,100
No!

339
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,867
We're gonna steal the moon!

340
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,533
Get the money!

341
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,083
Hey, grab as much as you want,

342
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,067
but I literally have
5 police officers over there,

343
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,967
'cause this is real money,
and they'll just get it back

344
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,833
And with that…

345
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,583
one final challenge stands
between your team

346
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:06,633
and $250,000 for your fans.

347
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,267
And this final round is simple:

348
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,500
the first team where all 4 players make it
to the top of that hill will win.

349
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,767
You are literally only as good
as your weakest link.

350
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,083
We got no weak links here.

351
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:21,067
Tens of millions of people watching,

352
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,483
money for your fans on the line,
your team counting on you--

353
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:25,783
I'm just trying to make you nervous.

354
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,200
I don't get nervous.

355
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,017
Go!

356
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,983
Go, go, go!

357
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:29,917
Ok, guys, this is it.

358
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,667
We know what to do.

359
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Do not hit the yellow thing.

360
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,733
Oh, I'm dodging, I'm dodging.

361
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,883
Careful of the launch pad here.

362
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:36,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,667
And for the fire,
I'm using the launch to get across.

364
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,450
Let’s go.

365
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,150
Ok. Watch out.
It's gonna launch us forward.

366
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,017
But we live for that.

367
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,000
Bombs are getting launched
from the side, guys. Watch out!

368
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Big balls!
Oh! Oh my God.

369
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,983
Bro, your team is so far behind.

370
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:49,900
Dude, are they really?

371
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,100
- Yeah, you're crushing.
- Don't tell me that!

372
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,067
Your team's not even
on the same floor as you.

373
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,717
Oh my God.
Now, I'm not.

374
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,400
Well, never mind.

375
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,383
Oh my God!

376
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,317
Dude, I'm so lost.
I'm not gonna lie. I'm so lost.

377
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:00,983
I hit it, I hit it.

378
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,417
Oh, we're good. Keep going--

379
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,800
No! I got launched off.

380
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,400
There's, like rolling, uh--

381
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:08,017
Oh my God, there's big bombs and
they launch you off the map.

382
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,450
Oh, the hammer hit me, bro.

383
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:11,683
Guys, I don't know where I am.

384
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,450
If you're ahead of us,
just stay there. It's ok.

385
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,733
Go to the trampoline right here, though.

386
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,900
- Ali, right here. The trampolines.
- Yes, yes, I see them.

387
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,083
The stakes are high.
Everything's on the line.

388
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,300
You can tell people are starting
to get a little nervous.

389
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,067
No one wants to be the person
that lets their team down.

390
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,433
Everything is on the line.

391
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,683
Wait, oh, wait.
I'm supposed to be going the other way.

392
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,683
Guys, I'm all turned around!
Where am I?

393
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,617
No, a trampoline right here!
Behind you

394
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,067
Once you make it far enough,
trampolines unlock.

395
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,983
And when you fall,
you can skip right back up.

396
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,067
Am I supposed to go this way?

397
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
Oh, wait. Am I going the wrong way?

398
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,867
Are we going the wrong way?

399
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,750
Wait, I just hit a thing.
Wait, come to me, guys.

400
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:43,983
Yeah, I'm ahead.

401
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,333
Yeah, get on that.
I’ll press it for you.

402
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:48,783
Ok. Oh, no…

403
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,517
Open!
I got it, I got it.

404
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,800
It's open now.

405
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,000
You're both at the same spot.
It's neck and neck.

406
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,700
I think I hit a checkpoint.

407
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,617
Here guys, I have a trampoline.

408
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,300
Ok, ok.

409
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,200
Can I help you guys when I'm through?
Like what--

410
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,717
Oh, maybe I do.
Hold on…

411
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,267
Devonte jumped off!

412
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,967
I'm gonna go ahead.
I see where a trampoline is.

413
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,150
Wait, I think I messed up.

414
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,817
I hit another trampoline.

415
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,367
Oh, guys, I'm at the top,
so I activated all the shortcuts.

416
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,050
- I'm at the top waiting.
- Ok. I’m coming.

417
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,217
Ok, I'm almost there.

418
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,383
Alright, purple has someone
at the finish line.

419
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,150
Ok. That's fine, that's fine.

420
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,533
I did it. I'm at the end!

421
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,483
Wait, trampoline right here!

422
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:27,483
Guys, behind you!

423
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:28,517
Behind, behind us!

424
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,833
Lana, over here. This way.

425
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:30,717
I’m good.

426
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:32,767
Ok, I'm up!

427
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,083
Ok. I'm making my way through.

428
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm so confused right now.

429
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:37,750
Oh my God.

430
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,383
Ok, now go forward.
Go forward right here.

431
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Juke this way.

432
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,750
Right here.
Wait, where are you?

433
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,350
We’re here, we’re here!

434
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,833
I’m here, Purpled. I'm here!

435
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:47,950
Let's go!

436
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:48,983
Oh my gosh!

437
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,950
[celebrating]

438
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:52,917
Let's go!

439
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,517
Purple is the winner!

440
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,133
